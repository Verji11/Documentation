   <h2>Interdisciplinary Project Winter Semester 2018/2019

    <h2>Week 3:Introduction to the program Fusion 360</h2>
    <p>In this part our group of Fabrication of Care has learned how to deal with the Computer Aided Design(CAD) using the program Fusion 360 for modelling.We was introduced how to learn the basics of 3D modelling and how to create some stuffs in it.It was really interesting to get familiar with this program.In order to do this we have the opportunity to create different shapes,to combine them and to get one product.</p>
    
    <p>For example ,we was pleased to understand how to make a cube,or the transformation of this in sphere and also which alternatives they will have when extrude them.Moreover,this is a tool which can help you to explore the different transformation of this shapes,to modernizate them.In addition,it is very important wire doing this shapes to identify the right dimension and the right combination of the shapes.</p>
    
    <p>We had the opportunity also to try the modelling with our own shapes: </p>
