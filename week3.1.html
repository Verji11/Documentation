   <h2>Interdisciplinary Project Winter Semester 2018/2019
Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences FabLab Kamp-Lintfort</h2>
      
    <p>Group:Fabrication for Care</p>
    
    <h2>Week 3:Introduction to the program Fusion 360</h2>
    <p>In this part our group of Fabrication of Care has learned how to deal with the Computer Aided Design(CAD) using the program Fusion 360 for modelling.We was introduced how to learn the basics of 3D modelling and how to create some stuffs in it.It was really interesting to get familiar with this program.In order to do this we have the opportunity to create different shapes,to combine them and to get one product.
    Therefore,they are existed a lot of tools in the program which has to be carefully examined by the user in order to get a good model.</p>

     <h2>What is CAD Modelling?</h2>
    
    
    <p>Computer-aided design (CAD), explicitly referred to as software and hardware tools for geometric modeling, enabling the design and testing of industrial products in the virtual environment (computer and computer simulation) and the tools required for their production.

CAD systems have replaced the drawing board as well as many routine tasks in designing documentation for mechanical, electrical or electronic products. They are used in industries such as precision machine building, machine building, automotive, aerospace, shipbuilding, dentistry, architecture and civil engineering.

According to their purpose, CAD systems can allow both modeling of 2D and 3D modeling.</p>

   <p>The program has a lot of opportunities to create different objects ,with different dimensions which on the other hand has to be suited for late usage of the object for example for 3D Printing.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>For example ,we was pleased to understand how to make a cube,or the transformation of this in sphere and also which alternatives they will have when extrude them.Moreover,this is a tool which can help you to explore the different transformation of this shapes,to modernizate them.In addition,it is very important wire doing this shapes to identify the right dimension and the right combination of the shapes.</p>

    <h2>3D CAD Modeling</h2>

<p>The creation of 3D CAD models (Computer-Aided Design) of objects, captured by 3D laser scanner, represents the transformation process of the three-dimensional point clouds into a virtual reality which is intended to solve specific tasks concerning the reconstruction, simulation and animation of the detected environment and its objects. 3D CAD-modeling based on 3D laser scanning is applicable in many business areas, incl. construction, automotive industry, shipbuilding and ship repair industry, aerospace, ports and airports, power plants, factories, oil refineries, architecture, medicine, etc.
The object-oriented 3D CAD modeling is used to create digital simulation of infrastructures, buildings, plants and installations for quality improvement and quality assurance of the design and production process.</p>
    
   
    <p>We had the opportunity also to try the modelling with our own shapes: </p>
    
    <img src="https://imgur.com/WxtrYCk.jpg">
    
    <p>For example,this shape I made like first choosing the shape itself,it will be circle or square or other,after that I start to make the dimensions for the shape and finaly to extrude it,to have this form,which will be printed after finishing.Meanwhile,there are other special parts and forms which can be used,more complex. </p>
    
    <img src="https://imgur.com/VbKE9xj.jpg">
    <p>However,it is possible to rotate the shapes in order to review them in any angle.in addition the following process consist of making such a basic models.</p>

    <h2>Process of modelling.How it works?</h2>
    
       <ul>
    <li>Modelling based on sketches</li>
           <h2>Creating geometry based on sketches</h2>
           <ol>
     <li>Step 1:Getting start with the program.At first we have to choose which type of sketch we will model.As shown in the picture below there is a few options when we press the Sketch button.</li>
               
               <img src="https://imgur.com/ZGN8dWR.jpg";width="800"height="600">
               
<li>It can be a triangle,circle,quadrath or other shape.For example,I choose a circle shape to start drawing a model.It can be a center diameter or different ponts of circle.In the right side it is shown that we can see the shape from the top,right,left,down in other words in any angle.</li>
               
         <img src="https://imgur.com/Uc4128w.jpg";width="800"height="600">   
               
    <li>Step 2:Starting to draw the sketch.In order to draw the model,I choose to make the circle in the center line.After,making the sketch,as it shown in the picture below,we can choose different size of the diameter of the circle.It can be smaller or bigger,in this case I choose a 60 mm diameter for my shape.</li>

    <li>Step 3:Starting the Extrude command.After,sketching and the choosing of the diameter of the shape,we will try now the extrude option in the program.We click on the selected area,and then we press the button Create and we choose the command Extrude.</li>
               
    <img src="https://imgur.com/cHspC83.jpg";width="800"height="600">   
     
               
               <li>As show in the pictures we can determine how much mm we can extrude our shape.We do this by specifying the press button on the right.then,we just use the mouse and changing the shape.</li>

           </ol>
           
    <h2>Modyfing the shapes</h2>
           
           
           <p>The software has the opportunity to modify and to change ,and create over other shapes,different methodologies.In order to do this,we click on the modify and there are appearing different ways to model the shapes.</p>
           
           <img src="https://imgur.com/a0J8YOE.jpg";width="800"height="600">
           
      
           <p>In my case,in order to see how it works,I choose to option shell,which remove some of the material by making a hollow in the shape,in which it was choosen.And this is the result.</p>
           
            <img src="https://imgur.com/JYjF3wk.jpg";width="800"height="600">  
               
           
    <li>Practice and learn the basics in the program</li>
           
           
    <li>In order to learn how to model,it is good to practice and make different things and to get known with the program.For example,we use this shape to create another form into the circle in which we make a hole.I choose a triangle,which can be an extension for example to combine another circle or any other shape in order to have a usage in some fields for creating models.</li>

           <li>As is shown in the picture,this may be a model for example,with the people with disabilities like an extension for person who dont have a hand,to make a such kind of proteses.In addition,it is really important to consider the right dimension of the shape with same parameters between the different objects. </li>
