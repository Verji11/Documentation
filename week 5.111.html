 <h1>3D Laser Scanning, Modeling,Processing images and Cutting materials</h1>   
    <h2>Interdisciplinary Project Winter Semester 2018/2019
Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences FabLab Kamp-Lintfort</h2>
      
    <p>Group:Fabrication for Care</p>
    <h2>Week 5:Scanning, processing and cutting the objects and materials</h2>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Demonstration of three-dimensional laser scanning techniques with application in engineering practice</li>
    <li>Conversion on 3D scanned object in CAD format</li>
    <li>Comparison on scanned 3D oject with CAD model</li>
    </ul>
  <p>After scanning the part of body,we was learning how to deal with the processing of these parts,using the extension of the program Fusion,with new features and also how to convert them in correct format with the program Meshmixer.The interesting part was that using these programs we was able to change the appearance of the models,using different constuctions and modify them in different ways. </p>
    
    <h2>Example of scanned hand</h2>

    <h2>Diffrent modifications of the hand and the cutting part</h2>
    
    <p>In order to see how the different processes works,we try to at first put the object into a conus,the aim of this was to try the options in the program which will may help us</p>

    <p>The process is as follow in the picture.We use the scanned hand uploaded in the Fusion program,in order to make the modifications.This one is a simple,to figure out how it works.In order to do this,we sketch a circle in the bottom of the object,then we choose the extrude option and we cover to the up the hand.</p>

<h2>Cutting the part of the hand</h2>
    
    <p>Process of cutting</p>
    
    <p>After,scanning this part of the body,we try to cut some part of it using the program Fusion 360.As shown in the picture below first we have to make a line which will consider which part we would like to cut.This we make by choosing the option sketch and then create line.After that we press modify then the tool which we choose is split body.</p>

    <p>The modification of the objects is widely used to work with different features,to explore the ways to change something really simple into complex modified objects,in order to be unique. </p>

    <p>The scanner is a peripheral device that inserts a certain type of graphic information into a computer.

The scanner is used to capture (digitally display) a document or image that can then be used on computers. As a result of the scanner's work, files are captured with the captured objects - photographic pictures, documents, or real 3D objects.

The basic principle of the scanner is similar to the fax system, both of which integrate a transmitter and receiver into a single device. However, the fax machine (because its purpose is to transmit and receive images) connects to another fax machine elsewhere, one transmitting and the other accepting the image.</p> 
    
    <h2>From 3D to 2D (Working with Exactflat)</h2>
    
    <p>What is Exactflat?This tool can be used as extension which is online developer in the program Fusion.Its characteristics are that this tool,can be used to process prototypes for making 2D and 3D designs and patterns.It is a digital software which are simple developed to make designs and modification of any textile and composites of your nodel.</p>
    
    <h2>Cutting materials </h2>
    
    <p>After creating the material or the model there are machines which are used to crop them,depends on their size.Laser cutting is a technology that uses a laser to cut materials, and is typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, but is also starting to be used by schools, small businesses, and hobbyists. Laser cutting works by directing the output of a high-power laser most commonly through optics. The laser optics and CNC (computer numerical control) are used to direct the material or the laser beam generated. A typical commercial laser for cutting materials involved a motion control system to follow a CNC or G-code of the pattern to be cut onto the material. The focused laser beam is directed at the material, which then either melts, burns, vaporizes away, or is blown away by a jet of gas,leaving an edge with a high-quality surface finish. Industrial laser cutters are used to cut flat-sheet material as well as structural and piping materials. </p>
    <p>Laser cutting is a method of cutting sheet material without any limitations in shape and contours. It is a quick and efficient tool for laser cutting of sheet material. In the correct choice of this method, depending on the specificity of the cut, the size of the batches of the products, laser cutting is the fastest and most advantageous method of cutting sheet material.</p>

    <p>This is the machine of cutting the materials,the Laser Cutter.The materials which we can use can be different,starting from a soft textile until to diffrent types of leather.</p>

    <p>How it works?In this part we was shortly introduced,how the Laser Cutter works and the features of it.Generation of the laser beam involves stimulating a lasing material by electrical discharges or lamps within a closed container. As the lasing material is stimulated, the beam is reflected internally by means of a partial mirror, until it achieves sufficient energy to escape as a stream of monochromatic coherent light. Mirrors or fiber optics are typically used to direct the coherent light to a lens, which focuses the light at the work zone.</p>

    <p>Advantages of laser cutting over mechanical cutting include easier workholding and reduced contamination of workpiece (since there is no cutting edge which can become contaminated by the material or contaminate the material). Precision may be better, since the laser beam does not wear during the process. There is also a reduced chance of warping the material that is being cut, as laser systems have a small heat-affected zone. Some materials are also very difficult or impossible to cut by more traditional means.</p>
