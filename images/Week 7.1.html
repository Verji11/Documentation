    <p>The branch of engineering in which the flow and control of electrons in vacuum or semiconductor are studied is called electronics. Electronics can also be defined as the branch of engineering in which the electronic devices and their utilization are studied.

The motion of electrons through a conductor gives us electric current. This electric current can be produced with the help of batteries and generators.

The device which controls the flow of electrons is called electronic device. These devices are the main building blocks of electronic circuits.

Electronics have various branches include, digital electronics, analog electronics, micro electronics, nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, integrated circuit and semiconductor device.</p>
    
    <p>In addition there are a lot of advantages of electronics.Electronic devices are playing a major role in everyday life. The various electronic devices we use in everyday life.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Computers</li>
    <li>Mobile phone</li>
    <li>Television</li>
    <li>Digital cameras</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>What role play the electronics for our project?</p>
    <p>Electronics play an very important role for the final project of the group fabrication for Care.Every part of that we want to create is connected to some electronic devices or the electronic mehanism itself.</p> 
    
    
    
    <p>After the short introduction to the electronics ,our group start to share individual ideas about the final project and how complex are they or not that much.The most interesting part was that every individual has a own idea how can contribute to help people with disabilities or other problems and in which way this will help to the world itself.</p>
<h2>Learning about electronics and introduction to Adruino program</h2>
    
    <p>Our group of Fabrication for Care was pleased to get into Arduino board.After that we install a software Arduino to make a connection between them.Then,we connect the minus to the ground GND and the plus into 5 Voltage.The board consist of digital and analog parts.From the digital part GND the black cable was connected to the other board which is white with the plus and minus cable and from the analog the brown cable was from 5 V to the plus side of the white board.Meanwhile,we connect the LED in the different board and then the long leg in the plus side and the short in the minus.The important part was to disconnect the USB cable from the laptop if you change cables from the board.The result from this was that the LED was lightning.</p>
